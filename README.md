## Project Description

I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results for middle schools. YMy data includes every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance. MY final report will include the following: 

* District summary
* School summary
* Top & bottom-performing schools 
* Math & reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending, size, and type

### Features & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas

## My Process

1. Create a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics
2. Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school 
3. Create tables that highlight the top & bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing
4. Create tables that list the average math and reading scores for students of each grade level at each school 
5. Create tables that break down school performances based on avg spending ranges per student, school size, and school type.
